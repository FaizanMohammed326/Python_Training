"""
Shallow Copy:
    A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references
into it to the objects found in the original.

Deep Copy:
    A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively,inserts copies into it
of the objects found in the original.

Both are imported from the module copy.

Shallow Copy stores the copy of the original object and points the references to the objects.
Where as Deep copy stores the copy of the original object and recursively copies the objects as well.
