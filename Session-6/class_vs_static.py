"""
Class Method:
    A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
A class method receives the class as an implicit first argument,
just like an instance method receives the instance
It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class.
For example, it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instances.

We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method

Static Method:
    A static method does not receive an implicit first argument.
A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
A static method canâ€™t access or modify the class state. i.e class variables

we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in python.
